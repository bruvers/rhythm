Rhythm is a a simplified version of the [Compass Vertical Rhythm](http://compass-style.org/reference/compass/typography/vertical_rhythm/) SASS mixin. Some functions have been removed, some have been renamed but, most importantly, all dependencies have been removed.

- @mixin establish-baseline() was renamed to @mixin baseline()
- @mixin apply-side-rhythm-border() was renamed to @mixin rhythm-border-side()
- leader(), padding-leader(), margin-leader(), trailer(), padding-trailer(), margin-trailer() mixins were removed
